Hi there, Internet! I'm Tre. Nice to meet you, or otherwise see ya again if we're already familiar.

This is my blog now. My "serious blog," if you will, a role previously held by [Tremulous One](http://tremulousone.tumblr.com), but a role that place is not going to be fulfilling anymore for a few reasons.

The first is primarily that I am broke. I paid for http://tremulousone.xyz early last year because I had to start a blog for a college class and I wanted to be interesting, but I gave it a thought when the time came to renew and I ultimately figured that it would be in my best interest to keep one personal brand for myself around, and Trespeak won out, because that name *is* me at this point. 

So, with that decision made, I opted to keep my whole thing going with two different blogs for two different purposes, but I wanted this next project to actually serve as more of a personal website too. For the past seven-odd years I've considered my Tumblr to be my home of sorts on the internet, but as I've gotten older it's become more and more clear that the service just plain isn't charitable to longer-form blogging, even if you can use it for that purpose.

I've also butted up against the cognitive dissonance that comes with not being able to completely control the way your blog on Tumblr feels or acts; if you're cool with having a giant header on your site on mobile, great, but there's no way to turn it off if you aren't, and God help ya if it messes with the functionality of your theme.

Yahoo's also getting bought out by Verizon, apparently, and I can't help but find that an even more grim turn of events than the initial Yahoo purchase of Tumblr was. (I'm a merger nerd, what can I say.)

So in my attempts to find the most economically viable way for me to be able to start a Real Website™, I stumbled across [NC.me](http://nc.me), a cool little service from my usual domain registrar [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com) that gives a free .me domain and Github Pages hosting to applicable college students (they say it's "select universities in the US, UK Canada, and Australia," and there's a list if you peep the FAQs). I took it as an opportunity to experiment with something new, and while wrestling with Jekyll and Github made things a bit difficult out of the gate for a boy with only a rudimentary understanding of the command line, I think this approach is going to prove much more liberating than Tumblr ever was in the long run. Score.

I complain about it a lot, but I do still find myself attached to Tumblr, which is why Tremulous One will kind of continue to be a thing, but mostly just a thing that'll accompany *this* thing. (I'm thinking I'll set myself up some sort of automation to port all my stuff on here over. Time to learn IFTTT, I guess.) I'm also going to be keeping [Trespeak.xyz](http://trespeak.xyz), my somewhat popular blog for ~~shitposts~~ less wordy, more Tumblr-y stuff around with no changes. It's fun and I love it dearly.

As for this place's future, well, I've got ideas. I'll be moving features from the old blog like Tremulous Thoughts and any further game/movie/whatever reviews here, but I think the biggest new project of mine is my not-so-secret-plan to start a gaming podcast. Once I know everything about it, so will you, and it'll be right here.
