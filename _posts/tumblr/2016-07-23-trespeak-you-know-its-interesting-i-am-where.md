You know, it’s interesting. I am where I am today, a fully-paid-for college student about to go back to school with a 3.6, and it wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for the fact that I’m pretty good at standardized tests.

And yet, I can’t help but loathe the things, not only for the inherent ennui of them, but also because they don’t actually reflect the intelligence of the American high school student in much of any way whatsoever.

Take me, for instance. I was born without the ability to socialize on a normal level. I had to learn how human interaction worked from scratch, and it took a team of various educators and therapists just about a decade to get me anywhere remotely close to what we consider “normal,” for lack of a better word. 

Furthermore, along the way I amassed an almost encyclopedic collection of knowledge about things, or really, capital-T Things, the stuff that intrigued me. Logos and graphic design. Mergers and acquisitions, the parent companies of organizations and those parent companies’ parent companies. Histories and timelines of modern media. The shit I like to think about, y’know?

And none of that knowledge, none of those skills, _nothing_ that has made me Tre L. from one night in late 1996 to the time I sat down for the tests, is reflected in my SAT or ACT scores. To me, all those things are are numbers. Not numbers reflecting my intelligence, not numbers determining how ready I was for college as a junior in high school, they were just numbers.

I don’t know the answer to the question I’m implying exists (that question, of course, being “then how do we fix it?”), but I do think that the future leaders and creators of America deserve a better means of understanding them, because you just can’t try to understand a person from a number.
