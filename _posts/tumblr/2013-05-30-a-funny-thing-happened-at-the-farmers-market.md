So, a friend of mine runs a dessert and baked goods stand out at a farmers’ market that they hold every weekend in the rich part of the city I live in, and I decided to drop by because I’d been talking to her a lot over the internet and texts, but I hadn’t seen her in person for about a year.
My mom dropped me off to go find her, and after a bit of aimless walking around I found her calling for me under a tent. We greeted each other, exchanged a hug and did the friend thing, and then I asked if I could buy anything from the stand. She said there were a lot of bacon and cheddar scones left, and a single chocolate chip cookie left over from the previous sales because I’d gotten there during the last hour of the market.
The cookie was cheaper than the scones, so I opened up my wallet and started scraping up the change I’d found while cleaning my room up the day before. But just when I was going to make the purchase, I saw a little girl on the other side of the stand, gazing at the last cookie with eyes as big as Saturn’s moons.
Now, you can ask anyone in my family about my eating habits, and they’ll tell you I’m terribly greedy when it comes to that sort of thing. Sharing isn’t my thing when food’s involved. But when I looked at that little girl, I realized something. It was just a cookie. There’d be more just like it the next time I came to the stand, hopefully.
So when the girl’s dad came around to buy the cookie, my friend and I let the purchase go smoothly. I laughed a bit, and said that that was some perfect timing from the girl.
I ended up getting a scone. It cost me a dollar more than the cookie would have, but in the grand scheme of things I’d scrape that dollar up again somewhere else. Besides, I didn’t just buy a scone, I got the satisfaction of not being a terrible glutton, so that was a nice bonus!
If nothing else, it made the scone taste better.
