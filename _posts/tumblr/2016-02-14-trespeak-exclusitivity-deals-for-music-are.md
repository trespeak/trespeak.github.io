I get that most of them are just temporary type affairs, but come on, by the time Rihanna’s ANTI came out anywhere besides TIDAL nobody cared because Beyoncé had already put out Formation (also on TIDAL) and now Kanye’s TLOP is only legally accessible there, no option to buy it through iTunes or anything.

It’s not just TIDAL that bothers me, though, you’ve got EVOL by Future, literally everything by Taylor Swift (excluding features) and then Mýa’s new record locked up over at iTunes/Apple Music, and all signs point to the same thing happening to Drake’s new stuff going forward. It’s almost like there’s this mindset where you have to remember where that one artist will let you listen to their work before you even can do so, and then if you want to switch from one artist with an exclusive deal to another that isn’t on the same service you actively have to change whatever app you’re using, and that’s even if you have that service at all, which you probably don’t because who is going to pay for redundant shit?

It’s nonsense! They’re modeling the music industry after that of film, and it’s making it a pain in the ass for people like me who actually want to support artists but can only do so with free streaming or the rare album purchase. The technology has evolved to let anyone be able to listen to whatever tune they want at any time, but we’re stuck continuing on the dead spirits of LimeWire, Kazaa and MegaUpload to do it because digital music has turned into the lunch tables from Mean Girls.

Perhaps this wouldn’t be as big an issue if the historic streaming industry leader, Spotify, paid its artists in whatever manner they promised they would, and I don’t really know whether Spotify should be believed in that regard or its artists (which is part of the reason I’m not fully sure whether or not I wanted to get a premium account). The general excuse is that this happened with Spotify because they offered a free tier, but the secondary success of a certain little video service as a music provider says otherwise. 

(Side note: still appreciate them as much as anyone can do so with a multinational corporation, but Google taking away previously free features and shoving them behind the YouTube Red paywall was kind of a dick move.)  
 
I don’t see the deals going away any time soon, either, which is sad because I know what it’s like to feel diminishing returns on one’s work but I also feel like music’s one of those things that ought to be accessible to as many ears as possible.

**tl;dr** Tre’s pissed off not only because he can’t listen to Kanye without going to The Pirate Bay, but also because he really wouldn’t have to do that if that weren’t the way the industry were going.
