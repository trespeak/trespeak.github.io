Monsters University review: Scare tactics

If there was ever an animation studio that could take the most outlandish concepts and turn them into the best stories, it would be Pixar. From the short but sweet Andre and Wally B. all the way to the epic film feel they achieved with Brave, they’ve (nearly) continuously wowed, charmed and influenced an entire generation with their movies and shorts.
Monsters University is no exception to this. As only the second Pixar movie to act as an expansion to a series not named Toy Story and the first ever prequel to any of their films, its announcement seemed somewhat awkward, and the comedic nature of the advertising seemed to give the impression that this was a more childish affair than what we would’ve hoped.
Indeed, it does have its moments of immaturity, but who wasn’t a little prone to kiddy behavior during their college years? Nobody, that’s who.
As the name hints, Monsters U focuses on the exploits of Monsters Inc.’s Mike Wazowski and James P. “Sulley” Sullivan as they enter their first year of college at the eponymous school. Mike is the more studious of the two, while Sulley is definitely more of a “party first, work later” type. The two butt heads over who gets to be top dog in the school’s scaring program, but a freak accident leaves them both kicked out with no other option but to work together to find their way back in, with the help of a few misfit friends they pick up along the way— and possibly find out things they never knew about themselves and each other in the process.
The premise rings familiar, but like its predecessor in the Pixar collection Brave, Monsters U’s execution saves it from being an exact rehash of older films with similar concepts like Revenge of the Nerds. Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles as Mike and Sulley as if the 13-year gap between the movies was never there. Additionally, I’ve got to give credit to Charlie Day, Helen Mirren and Pixar’s own Peter Sohn, who give fantastic performances as Art, Dean Hardscrabble and Squishy. The charismatic performances from the rest of the cast make this movie just as fun to listen to as it is to see, and boy, is it a looker; everything about the aesthetic of this film, from the characters to the backgrounds and right down to the lighting is absolutely gorgeous. Don’t miss your chance to see it in theaters, folks— this film is a work of art in motion.
If for any reason Cars 2 left a bad taste in your mouth that even the great Brave couldn’t get rid of, never fear; Monsters U is the perfect palate cleanser. It may not be the greatest entry in the Pixar canon, but it takes almost all the things that made the first film fantastic and places them in a new context without skipping a beat.
######### 9/10
