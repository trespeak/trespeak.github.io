In your song Pop That you mention being “in that white Ghost, chasing Pac-Man”.
Now, like any good listener could figure out, this is primarily a reference to your Rolls-Royce, but just one thing: in Pac-Man, if the ghosts are white at all then Pac-Man’s the one chasing them. 
Still good wordplay though. Love the song. 
Yours,  
Tre
