<p>I have a love/hate relationship with a website.</p>
<p>No, not anyone I’ve met with said website. I mean the service itself, and it’s the one I’m publishing this on, Tumblr.</p>
<p>The love part was established in 2009, a year that seems like it was forever ago these days. I’d initially started using it as a replacement for WordPress, my old blogging service, because the design appealed to me and there was more freedom to do what you wanted with your space. I wasn’t around for MySpace’s heyday, but a lot of the same things that made it such a phenomenon in the early 2000s were also true of Tumblr, right down to the occasionally illegible custom themes.</p>
<p>It was also incredibly addictive. The amount of interesting stuff to be found on the site has always been one of the core strengths of the service, so much so that one of the slogans for the service was ‘follow the world’s creators.’ In its prime, it felt like the smaller, cooler Twitter, with a sleeker feel and revolutionary features like the askbox that brought users, be they friends from real life or complete strangers, together in a way that no other social media service really could.</p>
<p>The hate part is more recent. Now more than ever it seems like Tumblr is moving into directions that have alienated the established userbase in what can only be assumed is an extended attempt to simultaneously attract even more new users while also monetizing the service, as the latter has become more of a priority since the site’s grown to levels the management wouldn’t have dreamed of when I first joined. While I don’t blame Yahoo! entirely for this part of things, I can’t help but side-eye them a bit because they’ve owned the company since 2013.</p>
<p>It almost feels like it’s going backwards sometimes. 2015 in particular brought a number of changes to the service that would rile users up to the point of threatening to leave: a new layout for comments within posts on the dashboard, the removal of replies to posts and the ability to edit comments previously made on posts, and banner advertisements.</p>
<p>I’ve stated multiple times on my main blog that I’m not fully sure why I’m still even on Tumblr, and while I do kind of say it in jest, every joke has a bit of truth to it.</p>
