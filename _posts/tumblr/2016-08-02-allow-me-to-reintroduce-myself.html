<h2><i>My name is Tre, T to the R-E</i></h2><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/5301a60b439dfd34d98f4fb18d9f3004/tumblr_inline_ob9seaGP8L1rw93qd_1280.jpg" alt="image"/><p>Hello everyone. It&rsquo;s been a while! The last post I wrote specifically for this blog was almost two years ago, back when I was still in high school. I&rsquo;m still the same person, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of growing up in the time since I last posted around these parts.</p><p>So with that, a name change was in order, I suppose. Much as my old blog name amused, I think &ldquo;American Style Buffoonery&rdquo; has unintentionally started to send the wrong message. Hell, when you Google the phrase these days you get photos of Donald Trump before I show up at all&ndash; not to get political, but that isn&rsquo;t exactly the vibe you want to give off when you&rsquo;re starting (or, in my case, coming back to) a blog.</p><p>But what options did I have? Well, the option I went with, just like the previous name, ended up being an obscure reference to a bit of media I love. (This one&rsquo;s a little more relevant to the current me than Kim Possible was, though.)</p><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/c61766139ae07b9bf9bd0d09075ff1b9/tumblr_inline_ob9shgvpvz1rw93qd_1280.jpg" alt="image"/><p>In the fourth level of Tiny and Big in Grandpa&rsquo;s Leftovers, Tiny calls the Radio a &ldquo;tremulous slowpoke&rdquo; when his AI companion expresses concern for the player going in the wrong direction. The word ended up sticking with me after I found the quote, not only because it contained my name, but also for its distinctive sound.</p><p>Try saying it out loud. <i>Tremulous</i>. Fun, right? It means &ldquo;shaking or quivering slightly,&rdquo; or &ldquo;timid [and] nervous,&rdquo; if the definition Google produces has any weight. You might read that and think, &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s not a very good image to portray either.&rdquo;</p><p>And you know what? You&rsquo;d be completely right! No one wants to seem timid or nervous. We think any expression of fear or insecurity is demeaning, an affront to the self-made images we work so hard to try to show to the world. </p><p>But really, where&rsquo;s the fun in never showing weakness? To be timid is to be human. Is there anyone out there who truly isn&rsquo;t afraid of anything at all? Maybe there is someone out there who&rsquo;s decoupled themselves from everything they&rsquo;ve ever remotely been afraid of or nervous about, but I haven&rsquo;t met anyone like that.</p><p>I think we should own up to our insecurities. A lot of things make me nervous&ndash; the state of my country, the way other people see me, being a young black guy, the future, etc. etc.&ndash; ¬†but the way I handle those insecurities is what makes me the person I am, and I will never be demotivated by those things.</p><p>And with that, I guess I&rsquo;m The Tremulous One.</p><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/a3dfc9cd34669a3c7a85d763a0fee48d/tumblr_inline_ob9slrsDKj1rw93qd_1280.png" alt="image"/><p>In addition to the new theme and name, you may have also noticed that I&rsquo;m not calling myself Lyle Terry anymore over here. I still love the name and I will continue to use it for my endeavors in writing fiction if they ever resume in earnest, but I think when it comes to blogging it&rsquo;ll be better to write stuff as myself, or at least the version of myself that exists on the internet. </p><p>In an effort to try to consolidate my writing efforts, I&rsquo;ve also made most of the longform writing I&rsquo;ve done since 2012 (that I still care about, anyway) available right here, including the stuff that&rsquo;s still on my Medium account, my rants from my regular Tumblr <a href="https://trespeak.tumblr.com">@trespeak</a>, and the old movie reviews that were on my Kinja. </p><p>I still don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be doing regular updates quite yet because it takes more dedication than I can imagine myself having, but at least now there&rsquo;s a proper place for it when it does happen. If you like what you see, some notes or a follow are very much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks for reading and being here. It&rsquo;s good to be back. ‚úåüèæÔ∏è</p>
