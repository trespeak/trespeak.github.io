On the side of the house of my neighbors to the right, there’s a window. It’s the only break from the otherwise drab desaturated brown surrounding their home, but it’s pretty dull as well. All that’s on the other side is a wall. I can’t imagine it’d be very pleasant to look out of either. All you’d see was the infinite blue of my house’s siding.
Blue. The color of many things. Tumblr. The ocean. Earth. All of them, enigmatic, unpredictable. Sometimes it feels like all three go on forever but everyone knows they don’t, and it makes us sad, so we associate blue with that sadness, that disappointment. It’s why Picasso used it during his blue period, it’s why we think of it as being the color of tears, of rain.
But tears aren’t blue at all, nor is rain. They’re just water, after all, so they’re clear. But maybe water may not be as clear as we think— otherwise, why is Earth blue? I don’t think I’ll ever be able to answer that one.
But I have a theory, a cynical one no doubt created by the state of mind I’m in right now thanks to previous actions of mine and others that have created intense disappointment in me from my peers and myself. Maybe Earth is blue because of the amount of things we have to be sad about, and boy, it’s a number. The mere presence of pessimism is enough to dye the clear water into a color that reminds us that we should not be happy about the screwed up planet we live on.
But who said we had to listen? Nobody. We don’t have to be sad about the world because of the fact that it’s blue, or about its failings and troubles. We can feel however we wish.
We don’t have to look through the window.
