JACKASS PRESENTS: BAD GRANDPA REVIEW: OF GAGS AND GEEZERS

I’m a Jackass virgin. Or was, anyway. Everything I knew about the show and the movies came either through short snippets or trailers here and there, until I got to tag along with my sister to see Bad Grandpa, the de facto fourth film in the series. I hadn’t heard a thing about the film due to a relative lack of TV watching on my end recently, so all I knew was that it was a film involving stunts, pranks and bad grandpas.

Theoretically there’s no reason why any of the four films wouldn’t stand on their own, but it’s especially apparent here, given that it’s the first one they went for a plot with. Johnny Knoxville plays Irving, a recently widowed (and thirsty) old guy tasked with bringing his lovable grandson Billy to his father on a cross country trip after Billy’s mom is arrested (again) for drug abuse. As far as plot goes, that’s generally as good as it gets. The characters aren’t the most rounded out subjects you’ll see in modern film, but they provide just enough context for the film’s main attractions: its stunts and pranks. 

For the most part, Knoxville’s antics are played upon real folks from various locations, and their genuine bewilderment sets the audience up for a nice laugh at the whole scene on screen. It’s pretty clear he’s been doing this for years, but one of the more surprising efforts was that of his pint-sized partner Jackson Nicoll as Billy, who shows a pretty refined comedic acumen for his age. (Certainly better than what I had when I was that young…)

Not every joke in this movie made me laugh out loud, but the ones that did made the experience worth the while. It won’t go down in history as an achievement in comedy film (except possibly in that of physical humor), and that’s alright. Bad Grandpa is a film that is content with its own lack of depth, and it’s better for it. 

And hey, I wouldn’t mind seeing more Jackass after it, just because there had to have been more prior to this that kept folks coming back. So, mission accomplished, in that regard!
