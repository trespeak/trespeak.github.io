Trespeak, ironically enough, doesn’t feel very speak-y anymore, so I guess you could call this a personal blog? I don’t really want to say it’s that though because I named it “lyleterry” since I want stuff I wrote like my movie reviews and whatnot here too, and although those might be made by me they aren’t very personal or anything.
But yeah, it’s me. Don’t be alarmed. (Unless you dislike me, in which case, block me all you want, I won’t notice. :P)
