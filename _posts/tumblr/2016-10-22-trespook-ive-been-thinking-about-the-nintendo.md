trespook:

I’ve been thinking about the Nintendo Switch’s branding decisions since the reveal. (Certainly not the only one!)
What strikes me as so different about how they’re marketing this one isn’t so much the focus on older audiences in the reveal trailer itself; I think that’s just a focus now because that audience is the one that was excited to see what the NX was going to be in the first place, and as we get closer to the March launch we’ll see more in the vein of the usual mix of kid and adult focused ads.
Nah, it’s actually the branding, and particularly the color scheme, that strikes me as distinctive here. 
Think about it; the Wii’s almost ten years old, and both it and the Wii U largely eschewed the traditional bold Nintendo red in favor of a more neutral gray. (The original version of the logo was still used, albeit not nearly as much as it was up until the GameCube.) In addition to that, the ads only drew attention to the Nintendo brand when it was an absolute necessity; otherwise it was simply the “Wii,” nothing more, nothing less. We can attribute this change to Nintendo’s effort with the Wii to appeal to a broader audience; by leaving the old brand behind, it let the Wii name take center stage.
This decision was a massive success in the case of the Wii itself (the console is the third highest selling home console ever, only bested by the Sony PlayStation 2 and its predecessor), but sticking with it and the Wii brand in general for a second generation proved disastrous. The very same audience Nintendo courted with the Wii wasn’t sure if the Wii U was a new console entirely or just an accessory, and the company went from leading its generation to the dreaded third place role.
With the Switch, the company’s gone back to the red that defined them before the Wii; it’s part of a strategy that, for the time being, clarifies that this is a machine meant for the fans, and hopes to court them by bringing back memories of the days when they played with power. (The company doesn’t seem to be leaving more casual fans in the dark, though; just look at Pokémon Go.)
In addition, the logo and the device itself bear the name “Nintendo” not simply as an identifier, but as part of the identity, unlike the Wii and the Wii U. After ten years of de-emphasizing the manufacturer on the home consoles, it’s a refreshing change of pace.
Only time will tell if the branding decision pays off, but for now, I think we can just appreciate the change and await further development on it. (Also, did you guys see that lime green 3DS? Holy shit I want one.)
