It’s funny how well we remember our relationships with certain musical acts for extended amounts of time. Me, I don’t think I’ve had such a long and satisfying connection in any other case but the one of my love of the work of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, more commonly known as Daft Punk.
The first time I remember having heard anything by the robots was when I was about six or seven, living in an alternate universe version of the same house I do now, and my aunt was taking care of me because my parents had jetted off to Indiana or somewhere for my sister’s now-defunct track running arrangements. My dad wanted me to make a playlist of good music for them to listen to when they got back, so I’d kept Radio Disney blaring out through Music Choice on our big screen TV for hours, waiting for some fantastic song to come and sweep me off of my little feet, for me to buy on iTunes and put on that playlist, that amazing, random playlist, that little Tre-Tre loved every single song on.
And then, in the middle of that afternoon, they played that song. It wasn’t like anything I’d heard before, that one song, but it didn’t need to be. It was so different than anything Disney had loaded up that afternoon that skipping it for the playlist was a crime of the highest order.
I had to have that song.

“One more time, we’re gonna celebrate Oh yeah, alright, don’t stop the dancin’ One more time…”
I can’t remember whether or not my family liked the rest of my playlist but by the time I was ten years old, in my house One More Time had gone from a simple Radio Disney song to a feeling, a kind of euphoria that very few songs I’ve heard before or after have really duplicated for me.
 But I’d never listened to much more Daft Punk other than that (besides Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger and Technologic)— not until I was 12 years old, when on a whim I’d decided to get Discovery as a bit of an experiment. I enjoyed the rest of the album a lot, but I really, REALLY adored one particular song on it because it expressed a side of me I was just starting to find in myself at the time, and that made it stand out. Moreso, I thought it had an emotional quality that One More Time lacked, and as an angsty 12-year-old boy, well, it was the perfect fit.
“Last night I had a dream about you  In this dream, I’m dancing right beside you  And it looked like everyone was having fun  The kind of feeling, I’ve waited so long…”
After Discovery I’d dived into Alive 2007, and at first I didn’t know what to expect. I’d never listened to a live album before but I loved me some Daft Punk, so I went into the album with open ears on a road trip. I don’t know whether or not it was the lack of things to entertain me otherwise, but I almost feel like that made the album itself better— it’s all about the music with the robots, and when one is a bored preadolescent trapped in the cramped third row of a late 2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, aurally drowning into a lifelike dreamscape crafted by the artificial intelligence duo is less of a diversion from reality than it is a necessity to stay sane.
Then again, that just makes you wish you could see the world up close.
And so I wished. And wished. And still wished.
I’m still wishing now, but less so that Daft Punk will show up at my house tomorrow to show me the ropes and more that I’ll get to go to that dreamscape once again sometime while they’re still jetting around the world, around the world, but that time it’ll be for real, with the pyramid and the seas of people and the camaraderie of being somewhere where everyone really is having fun.
But until then, I’ve still got two more albums to start to love, and a third on the way. So I’m not ultimately concerned with them going on tour right now, nor am I going to pass judgement on Homework until I’ve had enough time with it (and the same applies to Human After All). I’m just going to shut up and enjoy the music.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some mildly viral gifs to tend to.
