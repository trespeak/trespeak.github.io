<p>I figured out why the Elmo ‘R I S E’ meme makes me so happy.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned before how autistic folks have Things (phrased elsewhere as ‘<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brenda-rothman/worried-about-special-interests-of-autism-and-your-child_b_3953796.html">special interests</a>’) that they develop a deep, passionate curiosity with that seems excessive to the uninitiated. (I’d say it was ‘obsessive,’ but that’s demeaning.)</p>
<p>Anyway, y’all know my more recent ones. Rayman, Tiny and Big, Destiny, Adventure Time, the stuff that I go on and on about here, right?</p>
<p>Well, when I was younger I had two that still ended up staying to a degree: The Iron Giant (which has continued to be my favorite film of all time), and. </p>
<p>You fuckin’ guessed it.<br/></p>
<p>Sesame Street. With a particular fixation on Elmo. (Fun fact: my favorite color actually used to be red. Red like Elmo. I ended up changing it when BP changed their logo to their current one, and after that it just kinda stayed that way to the point of becoming a character trait.)</p>

I know every kid had that phase but I’m pretty sure I wasn’t a standard case. I was fascinated with Elmo, the brand they advertised him under back then (Sony Wonder), the people who made the merchandise (Knowledge Adventure and Tyco Toys, later Mattel after a buyout), <i>everything</i>.</p>

No? I do. Had the VHS, the DVD and the <i>soundtrack</i> to that shit. (Vanessa Williams was also in it, which might explain why I didn’t immediately dismiss <i>Ugly Betty</i> when it first aired.)</p>
<p>So yeah. Here’s an explanation on why I love a Thing even though it probably wasn’t even needed.</p>
<p>Have a pinata for your time.</p>
