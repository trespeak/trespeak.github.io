My name is Tre, T to the R-EHello everyone. It’s been a while! The last post I wrote specifically for this blog was almost two years ago, back when I was still in high school. I’m still the same person, but I feel like I’ve done a fair amount of growing up in the time since I last posted around these parts.So with that, a name change was in order, I suppose. Much as my old blog name amused, I think “American Style Buffoonery” has unintentionally started to send the wrong message. Hell, when you Google the phrase these days you get photos of Donald Trump before I show up at all– not to get political, but that isn’t exactly the vibe you want to give off when you’re starting (or, in my case, coming back to) a blog.But what options did I have? Well, the option I went with, just like the previous name, ended up being an obscure reference to a bit of media I love. (This one’s a little more relevant to the current me than Kim Possible was, though.)In the fourth level of Tiny and Big in Grandpa’s Leftovers, Tiny calls the Radio a “tremulous slowpoke” when his AI companion expresses concern for the player going in the wrong direction. The word ended up sticking with me after I found the quote, not only because it contained my name, but also for its distinctive sound.Try saying it out loud. Tremulous. Fun, right? It means “shaking or quivering slightly,” or “timid [and] nervous,” if the definition Google produces has any weight. You might read that and think, “wow, that’s not a very good image to portray either.”And you know what? You’d be completely right! No one wants to seem timid or nervous. We think any expression of fear or insecurity is demeaning, an affront to the self-made images we work so hard to try to show to the world. But really, where’s the fun in never showing weakness? To be timid is to be human. Is there anyone out there who truly isn’t afraid of anything at all? Maybe there is someone out there who’s decoupled themselves from everything they’ve ever remotely been afraid of or nervous about, but I haven’t met anyone like that.I think we should own up to our insecurities. A lot of things make me nervous– the state of my country, the way other people see me, being a young black guy, the future, etc. etc.–  but the way I handle those insecurities is what makes me the person I am, and I will never be demotivated by those things.And with that, I guess I’m The Tremulous One.In addition to the new theme and name, you may have also noticed that I’m not calling myself Lyle Terry anymore over here. I still love the name and I will continue to use it for my endeavors in writing fiction if they ever resume in earnest, but I think when it comes to blogging it’ll be better to write stuff as myself, or at least the version of myself that exists on the internet. In an effort to try to consolidate my writing efforts, I’ve also made most of the longform writing I’ve done since 2012 (that I still care about, anyway) available right here, including the stuff that’s still on my Medium account, my rants from my regular Tumblr @trespeak, and the old movie reviews that were on my Kinja. I still don’t think I’ll be doing regular updates quite yet because it takes more dedication than I can imagine myself having, but at least now there’s a proper place for it when it does happen. If you like what you see, some notes or a follow are very much appreciated.Thanks for reading and being here. It’s good to be back. ✌🏾️
