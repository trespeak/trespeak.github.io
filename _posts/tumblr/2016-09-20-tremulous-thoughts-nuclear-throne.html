Right now he‚Äôs thinking about a game he actually can play so as to take his mind off of <a href="https://www.destinythegame.com/rise-of-iron">a game that he can‚Äôt</a>. The salt is real.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Everyone&rsquo;s got a set of genres they stick to in gaming. It&rsquo;s only human to stick with familiar things, right? There isn&rsquo;t anything wrong with curling up and enjoying a game in a style you&rsquo;re comfortable with.<br/></p><p>My personal favorites are the platformer and the FPS. Of the 64 games currently living in my Steam library (according to my Mac, anyway&ndash; I think it&rsquo;s missing some things, but whatever), half of them fit in one or both of those categories. That isn&rsquo;t to say I exclusively play those kinds of game, though, far from it&ndash; some of my favorite experiences in gaming have been with rhythm, fighting, RPG, racing, action-adventure and even sports games. (SSX counts, snowboarding&rsquo;s a sport!) Those are my go-to genres, though&ndash; when I&rsquo;m looking for something to just occupy my mind, those are usually the ones I&rsquo;ll go for.</p><p>I think I ended up boxing myself in a bit by sticking with those, however, and in turn I&rsquo;ve been quick to judge experiences falling outside of my wheelhouse a bit too quickly for my own good.</p><p>My first experience with the roguelike (or roguelikelike, whatever the hell) was The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a game that I recognized the merits of and admired for its smart design choices, but found myself not really wanting to play very much of. I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t getting anywhere because I&rsquo;d always have to start over at the beginning after every death (let it be known that I am a pansy), and it was that believed pointlessness that basically made me keep it untouched between the first few times I played and when my Vita&rsquo;s screen broke (dearly departed, we will be reunited one day).</p><p>I would probably give it another shot now, though. Maybe on a different platform, but certainly when I get the chance.</p><p>Your question might be, &lsquo;well, if you weren&rsquo;t a fan what changed your mind?&rsquo; and I would probably respond with an airhorn noise and yell &ldquo;Nuclear Throne, sucka!&rdquo;</p><p>On second thought, I would not do that. But truth is, NT served as a far better introduction to the genre for me than Isaac did, despite having an extremely similar gameplay loop.</p><figure data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="851" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/e4c332b1378a19efab366c90cde765d4/tumblr_inline_odseuxjBCV1rw93qd_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="851"/></figure><p><i>(In case there was any doubt that the character that was made for Tre was Tre‚Äôs favorite, let me put those thoughts to rest. Pop pop.)</i></p><p>Like Isaac, NT is about as far from my standard gaming wheelhouse as you can get without being something like a strategy title. (Maybe I&rsquo;ll give one of those a shot someday!) The difficulty is absurd, death is permanent, it&rsquo;s a top-down shooter (#weird), and your time with a run is both A) almost certainly going to be short and B) most likely to result in failure. </p><p>And yet, it&rsquo;s hooked me. I fired it up for the first time on a Sunday night in early September and I spent a good hour dying, retrying, leveling up and losing it all, one broken journey to the eponymous Throne after another. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a strange loop to get used to if, like me, you grew up in an age of video gaming where respawns get handed out like candy on Halloween, but it turns out to be so much better in practice than in theory. Sure, nobody likes having to start over after a run goes south, but it&rsquo;s through that process that Vlambeer gets you to understand the mechanics, the ins and outs of every encounter&ndash; so that when RNGesus smiles upon you with your best run, you&rsquo;ll be ready for whatever it is you face next. </p><p>Well, maybe not &ldquo;ready,&rdquo; but. Surely a bit more likely to Not Suck.</p><figure data-orig-width="929" data-orig-height="302" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/63a1d9524b5d246683f13832ae178716/tumblr_inline_odsf6qWMNY1rw93qd_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="929" data-orig-height="302"/></figure><p><i>(The eternal struggle. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=465621838">Screenshot by Steam‚Äôs MFA in Anime, from their guide to the game</a>.)</i></p><p>It helps that Vlambeer peppered in a few side goals to give meaning to runs that you might not be able to go all the way with as well. There&rsquo;s no way to make dying not suck in a game where it&rsquo;s permanent, but unlocking new characters after reaching new areas in the game is a great way to soften the sting. </p><p>So. Two weeks and seven in-game hours have passed and the Throne is still about as distant as it was when I first started, but I haven&rsquo;t given up on getting to it just yet. I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m in this for the long haul. </p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll report back once I finally get around to parking my shiny butt on that chair where it belongs, but until then, I guess I&rsquo;ll be spending at least some of my time in the Wasteland, dying and retrying, dying and retrying.</p><p>Fl√§shyn!¬†‚úåüèæÔ∏è<br/></p><p><a href="http://nuclearthrone.com/">http://nuclearthrone.com/</a><br/></p>
