Okay, so I’m writing a series of books called Stuck, as a lot of you may know, and the main character’s basically a fictionalized version of myself (though I have tried to make him different from myself) named Tre Listman. Obviously the books focus on him, so it’d be alienating and dumb to make him a perfect, Adonis-on-earth kind of guy, wouldn’t it? I hate the term “Mary Sue”. Seriously. Mary Sues, Gary Stus, Marty Sues– whatever you may call it, it’s all rather stupid. I’ve taken a lot of the Mary Sue litmus tests on some of my Stuck characters, and most of them get okay scores– everyone, that is, except Tre. He always gets shafted on them since he’s “me, but better” – a signifying trait of a Mary Sue, which is more or less when an author fulfills their own wishes through a character. And sure, maybe I might do that a bit, but I can genuinely say that if I had to deal with teen mobsters, zombies, and being framed for ridiculously fabricated crimes, I would not be the Tre you’d see in Stuck, I’d be dead. So yeah, basically I don’t really find his character to entirely be based upon wish fulfillment.However, there is one thing I do kind of make sure I limit myself over, and that’s keeping him human. One of the books I’ve got planned is named Sparks, and that one has the Crew getting superpowers (Tre’s girlfriend can manipulate time, his best friend teleports, etc. etc.). Tre himself doesn’t though, and maybe I might be ridiculous for deciding that, but to be honest I want the whole cast, especially our hero (who’s kind of a dick sometimes, but not always) to seem a bit more real than I’ve made them before. Sure, I’d love to be able to shoot lightning out of my hands or something, but I know that even in the context of making my main character it’d be making me overpowered in comparison to everyone else.Well, that, and he’d probably end up electrocuting himself, but that’s a different matter entirely.Lyle.
