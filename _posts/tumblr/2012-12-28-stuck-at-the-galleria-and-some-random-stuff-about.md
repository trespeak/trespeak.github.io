So I have a book. I’ve kind of stalled in writing it and I may not actually get inspired any time soon for it, but I figured if anything might help me out in writing something (if not the book, then surely one of my short stories), it’d be talking about what actually does, y''know, inspire me.
Well, Tre, what are you inspired by?
Hmm. That’s a pretty interesting question. To tell you the truth, SATG and my writing in general are kind of like movies, but in prose form. At least, that was what I was hoping for, anyway. Shoot, I’ve got a poster up in my room for a movie adaptation for SATG. (That thing’s been up there since 2009!) 
I’ve kind of caught onto this more as I rewrote SATG, and I have my friend QDesjardin to thank for that. Q’s version of the prologue was pretty much perfect in balancing that fast cinematic action I wanted with a legit sort of nuance, common in those books you can’t seem to put down after a while. I knew I had to keep up with that, so that’s why the writing style I used evolved pretty massively afterward.
Well, that, and I reread the original book. Let’s just say I’m not a huge fan of it nowadays.
Feel free to read it, I don’t care. Just remember it was written by a wide-eyed sixth grader.
