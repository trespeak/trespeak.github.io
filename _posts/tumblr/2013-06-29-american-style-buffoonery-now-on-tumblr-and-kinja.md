Hey guys, Tre (or Lyle) here. If you’re reading this, chances are I’ve probably promoted the heck out of this post enough to convince you to come over to one of my blogs, one of which is brand new! I’m proud to pull the curtain on my newest venture, American Style Buffoonery on Kinja.
This blog’s going to serve as a nice hub for all of my reviews and long-form posts, so if you’re looking for a nice long read or two be sure to stop by http://lyleterry.kinja.com for a whole smattering of them.
If you’re following the Tumblr blog, however, don’t fret! Everything on the Kinja version of AmStyleBuff is going to transfer over going forward. The Tumblr will get all the content from the Kinja.
Thank you guys for reading and I hope you enjoy the new blog!
