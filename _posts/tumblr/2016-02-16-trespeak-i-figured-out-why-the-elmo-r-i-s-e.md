I figured out why the Elmo ‘R I S E’ meme makes me so happy.
I’ve mentioned before how autistic folks have Things (phrased elsewhere as ‘special interests’) that they develop a deep, passionate curiosity with that seems excessive to the uninitiated. (I’d say it was ‘obsessive,’ but that’s demeaning.)
Anyway, y’all know my more recent ones. Rayman, Tiny and Big, Destiny, Adventure Time, the stuff that I go on and on about here, right?
Well, when I was younger I had two that still ended up staying to a degree: The Iron Giant (which has continued to be my favorite film of all time), and. 
You fuckin’ guessed it.
Sesame Street. With a particular fixation on Elmo. (Fun fact: my favorite color actually used to be red. Red like Elmo. I ended up changing it when BP changed their logo to their current one, and after that it just kinda stayed that way to the point of becoming a character trait.)
Stuffed toy Elmos, board book Elmos, Elmo video games, I had it all. I know every kid had that phase but I’m pretty sure I wasn’t a standard case. I was fascinated with Elmo, the brand they advertised him under back then (Sony Wonder), the people who made the merchandise (Knowledge Adventure and Tyco Toys, later Mattel after a buyout), everything.
Remember this? No? I do. Had the VHS, the DVD and the soundtrack to that shit. (Vanessa Williams was also in it, which might explain why I didn’t immediately dismiss Ugly Betty when it first aired.)
So yeah. Here’s an explanation on why I love a Thing even though it probably wasn’t even needed.
Have a pinata for your time.
