Honestly, I’m really just hoping the Yahoo overlords don’t mess with a good thing here. I knew the purchase was going to happen as soon as the price became a factor (no sane person would turn down a billion dollars) so now it’s mostly just a matter of “Will Tumblr be worth using under the new ownership?”Because I feel like it’d be a shame for one of my favorite sites to go under due to a lack of proper management.Still. I’m going to stay cautiously optimistic. That billion should be good for the site for sure, and Marissa Mayer was a Google alum so she gives me a bit more comfort owning Tumblr than Terry Semel would. And Yahoo may or may not be evil, but one thing is definite: They’d have to be reeeeeeally crappy for me to consider leaving Tumblr over, because I love this website, and nearly every day for the past four years it’s made me laugh, cry, smile, and snort, and I don’t think there’s any other website in the world that’s shaped me into the person I am today quite like it. Not TVT. Not Instagram. Not Twitter. Not Facebook. Tumblr. Hey, Marissa. I doubt you’ll end up reading this because this post is probably drowning in the hate mail, but I don’t mind too much. Either way, I’ll say it.I trust you. And even though I know I’m just one measly, unpopular little blog with low Tumblarity and high word counts, I’m positive that if the guys who created the world’s (second) best website are willing to let your company take some of the load off, well, there’s got to be some reason for it. Just take care of it for me. Tumblr’s special, and I don’t ever want that to change. Signed,Tretrespeaklyleterry
